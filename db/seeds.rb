    {name: "test1", body: "The cat went here and there
    and the moon spun round like a top,
    and the nearest kin of the moon,
    the creeping cat, looked up.
    Black Minnaloushe stared at the moon,
    for, wander and wail as he would,
    the pure cold light in the sky
    troubled his animal blood.

    Minnaloushe runs in the grass
    lifting his delicate feet.
    Do you dance, Minnaloushe, do you dance?
    When two close kindred meet,
    what better than call a dance?
    Maybe the moon may learn,
    tired of that courtly fashion,
    a new dance turn.

    Minnaloushe creeps through the grass
    from moonlit place to place,
    the sacred moon overhead
    has taken a new phase.
    Does Minnaloushe know that his pupils
    will pass from change to change,
    and that from round to crescent,
    from crescent to round they range?

    Minnaloushe creeps through the grass
    alone, important and wise,
    and lifts to the changing moon
    his changing eyes"},

    as poet would wish to have,
    was much addicted to enquire,
    for nooks to which she might retire,
    and where, secure as mouse in chink,
    she might repose, or sit and think.
    I know not where she caught her trick,
    nature perhaps herself had cast her,
    in such a mold philosophique,
    or else she learnd it of her master.
    Sometimes ascending, debonair,
    an apple tree or lofty pear,
    lodgd with convenience in the fork,
    she watched the gardner at his work;
    sometimes her ease and solace sought,
    in an old empty watring pot,
    there wanting nothing, save a fan,
    to seem some nymph in her sedan,
    apparelld in exactest sort,
    and ready to be borne in court."},

    Dark brown is the river,

    It flows along forever,
    With trees on either hand.

    Green leaves a-floating,
    Castles of the foam,
    Boats of mine a-boating
    Where with all come home?

    On goes the river
    And out past the mill,
    Away down the valley,
    Away down the hill.

    Away down the river,
    A hundred miles or more,
    Other little children
    Shall bring my boats ashore."},
